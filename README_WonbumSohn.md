## 📄 Projects (pinned & resume-connected)

### 🌍 **Motor Unit Tracking from High-Density EMG + Ultrasound**
**Problem:** Non-invasive tracking of individual motor units across sessions is critical for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders.

**What I did:** Developed a transformer-based pipeline to decompose HD-sEMG signals and align with ultrafast ultrasound muscle motion.

**How I solved it:** Engineered modular preprocessing, transformer-based modeling, and robust session alignment.

**Outcome:** Demonstrated biopsy-free motor monitoring; contributed to NIH R21 project & co-authored a scoping review.

### 🔎 **AI-driven Autism Classification using fMRI & GNN**
**Problem:** Limited clinical models integrate white matter signals for ASD diagnosis.

**What I did:** Designed a Graph Attention Network (GAT) integrating gray and white matter connectivity.

**How I solved it:** Built full-stack fMRI pipelines using PyTorch, SPM12, and GNNExplainer.

**Outcome:** Achieved 80.4% accuracy (GM+WM); proposed pediatric transfer learning roadmap.

### 🎥 **Brain Decoding with CNNs during Movie Viewing**
**Problem:** Understanding brain responses to naturalistic stimuli remains challenging.

**What I did:** Extracted hierarchical CNN features from video frames and aligned them with fMRI BOLD signals.

**How I solved it:** Built VGG16-based pipeline; applied GLM and reverse mapping for interpretability.

**Outcome:** Published in *Psychoradiology*; revealed correspondence between CNN layer depth and brain hierarchy.

### 📍 **Facial EMG-based VR Avatar Control**
**Problem:** Camera-based facial tracking in VR raises privacy and occlusion concerns.

**What I did:** Developed EMG classifier for 11 emotions using CNNs.

**How I solved it:** Built real-time interface integrating signal processing and avatar logic.

**Outcome:** Enabled privacy-preserving emotion-based control in VR settings.

### 📊 **AI-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Skin Cancer Detection**
**Problem:** Early UV-induced skin damage is hard to detect non-invasively.

**What I did:** Designed a SLMK-CNN model for Raman spectral classification.

**How I solved it:** Modeled raw and processed spectra; highlighted molecular biomarkers.

**Outcome:** Achieved >96% accuracy; published in *Journal of Raman Spectroscopy*.
